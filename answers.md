## **Assignment Questions**

1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)

**Hardware:**

Hardware refers to the physical components of the DBMS, including output devices (printers, monitors) and storage devices (hard disks). It enables data access, updates, and provides a user interface through various devices like keyboards, scanners, and servers. The system can run on different types of computers, from microcomputers to mainframes.

**Software:**

Software consists of programs and routines that control the DBMS operations. It allows the computer to interact with the database, understanding commands and executing database operations. It provides an interface for users to manage data, and examples include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft Access.

**Data:**

Data in DBMS refers to raw facts stored in various formats, such as structured (specific format) or non-structured (native format). It also includes metadata (data about data) like size and name, which help manage and organize the actual data within the database.

**Procedures:**

Procedures are guidelines for using and managing the DBMS, such as setting up, backing up, and accessing the database. They ensure efficient database management, validate data, control access, and help reduce server-client traffic. Procedures are similar to database functions but focus more on the general usage and management of the DBMS.

**Database Access Language:**

Database Access Language allows users to write commands for interacting with the data stored in a database. It enables users to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. With this language, users can create databases, tables, and manage data. Examples include SQL (Structured Query Language), My Access, and Oracle. It typically consists of two types of languages: Data Definition Language (DDL) for defining data structures, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) for managing data.

2.What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.

A relational database is a category of database that contain data in tables that are related to each other in some way. Every table has rows (records) and columns (attributes) where each row depicts an entity while each column depicts a characteristic of the entity. The interconnectivity of tables is done by foreign keys (a field in one table that points to a row in another table).

**Key characteristics of relational databases**:

Tables (Relations): Data is stored in tables that are structured with rows and columns.

Primary Keys: A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.

Foreign Keys: A column in one table that links to the primary key of another table, creating relationships between tables.

SQL (Structured Query Language): Used to query and manipulate the data in relational databases.

**Examples of relational databases:**

MySQL

PostgreSQL

Oracle Database

Microsoft SQL Server

3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?

**Classifications of SQL (Structured Query Language)**

**1.Data Definition Language (DDL)**

Purpose: DDL statements are used to define, create, modify, and delete database structures such as tables, indexes, and schemas. They are essential for setting up the database's schema and managing its structural components.

**2.Data Manipulation Language (DML)**

Purpose: DML statements are used to manipulate the data within existing database objects. They allow users to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data, enabling dynamic interaction with the database.

**3.Data Control Language (DCL)**
Purpose: DCL statements manage access to data within the database. They control permissions and security levels for users and roles, ensuring that only authorized individuals can perform specific operations on the data.

4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?

**Primary Key**.

A primary key is a set of one or more fields/columns of a table that uniquely identifies a record in a database table. It can not accept null, or duplicate values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence.

Purpose: It enforces the uniqueness of records within the table.

**Foreign Key**.

A foreign key is an attribute that is a Primary key in its parent table but is included as an attribute in another host table. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table.

Purpose: It establishes and enforces a relationship between two tables, ensuring referential integrity (i.e., data consistency between related tables).

5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?

An entity relationship diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of how entities, such as people, objects, or concepts, relate to each other in a system. ERDs are a type of flowchart that use symbols like rectangles, diamonds, and ovals to show the relationships between entities.

6. What are the advantages of relational databases?

**Simple Model**:

Relational databases have a simple structure, requiring no complex architecture or queries. Simple SQL commands are sufficient for handling data without complicated processes.

**Data Accuracy**:

By using primary and foreign keys to relate multiple tables, relational databases eliminate data duplication, ensuring higher accuracy compared to other database systems.

**Easy Access to Data**:

Data in relational databases can be accessed without a fixed pathway. Users can query any table and combine multiple tables using joins and conditions to retrieve relevant data.

**Data Integrity**:

Relational databases ensure data integrity by maintaining strong data entries and validations, which help avoid inconsistent or incomplete records, thus supporting the accuracy and reliability of the system.

**Flexibility**:

Relational databases are flexible, easily adapting to changing data and business needs. They allow for seamless updates, expansions, and changes without affecting the overall system stability.

**Normalization**:

Normalization ensures that the database structure is organized, free of redundancy, and adheres to specific rules, promoting data integrity and reliability. The process aims for a normalized structure, typically meeting third-normal form (3NF).

**High Security**:

Relational databases offer strong security by allowing data segregation, user access control, and permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific tables or data.

**Feasible for Future Modifications**:

The organized structure of relational databases makes it easy to modify, insert, or delete records to meet evolving requirements, ensuring adaptability to future changes without disrupting the system.

7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?

**INT (Integer)**:

Used to store whole numbers without decimals.

Example: age, quantity, order_id.

**VARCHAR (Variable Character)**:

Used to store variable-length strings (text).

Example: name, email, address.

**DATE**:

Used to store date values (year, month, day).

Example: birth_date, order_date.

**DECIMAL or FLOAT**:

Used to store numbers with decimal points (for precise or approximate values).

Example: salary, price, balance.

8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)? 

Data Storage and Retrieval: A DBMS is used to store a vast amount of data in a structured way so that they can be easily accessed, modified or erased.

Data Integrity: It ensures compliance with standards and limitations (primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints) to ensure that the information is correct and consistent.

Data Security: A DBMS offers tools to secure data from unauthorized users by means of controlling access, identifying users, and permitting or denying them access to data.

Concurrency Control: It controls the concurrency that is the ability of many users to access the database at the same time without the system being compromised or containing conflicting information.

Backup and Recovery: It has the means for data backup and data recovery in case of loss of data through system failure or disaster.

Data Independence: A DBMS stores data and application in different areas, and modifications in the structure of the data do not affect the application, which makes it data independent.

Ease of Use: It makes the interaction with the data easier by employing easy to use query languages (for example SQL) which enables the users to work with the data even without requiring extensive computer knowledge.
